This dataset contains synthetic question–answer pairs generated using
a document-grounded language model with access only to approved
Computer Networks textbooks, class notes, syllabus, and sample
question papers. The dataset is used as seed data for constructing a
textbook-grounded training dataset. No external internet sources or
third-party datasets were used.
