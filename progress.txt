DETAILED PROJECT EXPLANATION - MCA FINAL YEAR PROJECT
PROJECT TITLE:
"An Academic Doubt Clarification System Using a Syllabus-Grounded Fine-Tuned Small Language Model"

🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW
Objective: Build an AI system that provides syllabus-aligned, textbook-grounded answers to Computer Networks academic doubts while minimizing hallucinations and ensuring strict syllabus relevance.

Key Innovation: Unlike generic chatbots, this system enforces strict syllabus boundaries and uses only approved academic content (no internet sources).

📚 SUBJECT SCOPE & CONTENT
Subject: Computer Networks (MCA Curriculum)

Syllabus: 5 Units (Official University Syllabus)

Primary Textbook: "Data and Computer Communications" – William Stallings

Secondary Textbook: "Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach" – Kurose & Ross

Additional Sources: Faculty notes and PPTs

Content Policy: NO internet or unapproved sources

🏗️ ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES
Syllabus for Scope Only: Used ONLY for relevance validation, never for answer generation

Textbook-Grounded Answers: All responses must come from approved textbooks/notes

Hierarchical Priority: Stallings (primary) > Kurose (secondary) > Notes > PPTs

No Hallucination: Strict content boundaries prevent made-up information

📈 PROJECT PROGRESS (COMPLETED MODULES)
✅ MODULE 1: ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE INGESTION & PREPARATION
What We Built:

PDF Text Extraction: Automated extraction from textbooks, notes, PPTs

Content Cleaning: Removed headers, footers, page numbers, references

Intelligent Chunking: 300-500 token semantic chunks with metadata

Unit Classification: Mapped content to 5 syllabus units

Metadata Enrichment: Added source, priority, chapter, unit information

Technical Implementation:

# Key components built:
- extract_pdf.py: PDF text extraction
- clean_text.py: Content preprocessing  
- chunk_text.py: Semantic chunking
- process_all_sources.py: Complete pipeline

Copy
python
Output: 3,428+ processed chunks with rich metadata

✅ MODULE 2: TEXTBOOK SEMANTIC INDEXING
What We Built:

Sentence-BERT Embeddings: Using all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384-dimensional)

FAISS Vector Database: Optimized cosine similarity search

Textbook-Only Index: Strictly approved content (Stallings + Kurose)

Source Prioritization: Stallings results ranked higher than Kurose

Retrieval API: Sub-second semantic search with confidence scoring

Technical Implementation:

# Key components:
- build_index.py: FAISS index construction
- retriever.py: Semantic search API
- evaluate_indexing.py: Performance validation

Copy
python
Performance Metrics:

Index Size: 3,428 textbook chunks

Search Speed: Sub-second retrieval

Coverage: All 5 Computer Networks units

Accuracy: Relevant content retrieval validated

✅ MODULE 5 (PARTIAL): QUESTION RELEVANCE CHECKING
What We Built:

Semantic Similarity Engine: Question vs syllabus embedding comparison

Rule-Based Classification: Relevant/Partially Relevant/Irrelevant categories

Syllabus-Grounded Validation: Uses only approved syllabus content

Interactive Web Interface: Real-time relevance checking demo

Negative Filtering: Rejects non-CN topics (cryptocurrency, ML, etc.)

Technical Implementation:

# Key components:
- process_syllabus.py: Syllabus embedding generation
- relevance_checker.py: Main classification engine
- app.py: Flask web interface
- test_module5_simple.py: Validation suite

Copy
python
Classification Logic:

Score ≥ 0.28: RELEVANT (directly related to CN syllabus)

Score 0.15-0.28: PARTIALLY_RELEVANT (borderline CN topics)

Score < 0.15: IRRELEVANT (not related to CN)

Performance Metrics:

Test Accuracy: 87.5% (7/8 test cases)

Response Time: Real-time classification

Coverage: All 5 syllabus units mapped

🔧 TECHNICAL STACK
Core Technologies:

Language: Python 3.x

ML Framework: Sentence-Transformers (HuggingFace)

Vector Database: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
